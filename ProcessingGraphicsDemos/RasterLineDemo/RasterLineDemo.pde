// Explanation for Students (for raster_line.png):
/*
"Here, we're working with a fixed grid of pixels on our screen. When we tell
Processing to draw a diagonal line, it can't draw a perfectly smooth line
because it only has square pixels to work with. It has to decide which pixels
to 'turn on' to best represent that diagonal. This results in the 'stair-stepping'
or 'jagged' effect you see when you zoom in very close. This is called **aliasing**.
The PNG file saves the exact color of each of these individual pixels.
That's why when you zoom in on 'raster_line.png', you see the pixels getting larger,
and the line appears blocky â€“ the image's resolution is fixed."
